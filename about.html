                <h1 class="sub-title">EID UL FITR</h1><br>
                <p class="para">Eid-al-Fitr is a direct translation of “Festival of the Breaking of the Fast.”
                    Eid-al-Fitr is actually a three day long celebration after the end of Ramadan everyday from dawn to
                    dusk. Determining Eid-al-Fitr all comes down to a moon sighting, just like Ramadan: if the crescent
                    moon
                    isn’t seen, Ramadan will go on for another day. If it is seen, Eid Mubarak!</p><br>
                <h3 class="sub-title">How Does Muslim Celebrate Eid Ul Fitr!!!</h3><br>
                <p class="para">Muslims wear their newest clothes or their finest clothes. Muslims decorate their homes
                    with
                    Eid decorations, lanterns, and twinkling lights. Everyone makes special foods for when their
                    families
                    and friends are invited over to come celebrate alongside. Muslims visit their relatives’ homes, as a
                    way
                    to celebrate with their loved one.<br>
                    Hands are covered in henna patterns, from the nights before that were served as preparation for this
                    three-day long period. Gifts are given to children and those in need, which are commonly known as
                    Eidi.
                </p><br>
                <h3 class="sub-title"> What Is Eidi!!!</h3><br>
                <p class="para">Eid is still a day of charity. Eidi is referred to as the money and gifts
                    given to the children of the family by elders: could be relatives, parents, siblings, anyone at all.
                    Eidi gifts are given as another way of celebrating this joyous day. Children will definitely refer
                    to
                    their Eidi as their favorite part of the day!</p>

            <h1 class="sub-title">EID UL ADHA</h1><br>
            <p class="para">The twelfth month of the Islamic calendar is called Dhul Hijjah. It is the month that
                contains one of the greatest pillars of Islam – Hajj or the major pilgrimage. It also contains one of
                only two Islamic reoccurring festivals, Eid ul Adha. These two special occasions, the Hajj and Eid ul
                Adha.<br>
                Eid ul Adha commemorates a specific trial in the life of Ibrahim. He was commanded by God to sacrifice,
                his son Ishmael. Eid ul Adha occurs on the 10th day of Dhul Hijjah, the day on which most of the Hajj
                rites have been preformed and the pilgrims slaughter an animal to honour Prophet Ibrahim’s obedience to
                God.<br>
                In a divinely inspired dream, Ibrahim saw himself sacrificing his son Ishmael. All members of Ibrahim’s
                family demonstrated complete trust in God, therefore Ibrahim revealed the dream to Ishmael. He readily
                agreed that his father must carry out the command of God. Together they went to the place of sacrifice
                and offered Ishmael’s life to God. Ibrahim prepared to sacrifice his beloved son. At this point the
                shaytaan (satan) tempted Ibrahim trying to make him disobey God, but Ibrahim resisted and drove the
                shaytaan away. Ibrahim looked down at his son for what he believed was the last time but as the blade
                came close to Ishmael’s neck God stayed his hand and revealed that there was no need for Ibrahim to
                continue. His sacrifice had already been fulfilled.<br>

                Giving up something big for the sake of God, such as the life of your child, must seem like a huge and
                unimaginable sacrifice. Today even going without something small, such as a cup of coffee, to donate the
                money to charity seems like a large sacrifice. Try to imagine how Ibrahim must have felt as he held the
                blade above his child’s neck. In the last moment he was relieved of his duty to follow God’s commands.
                Having complete trust in God, knowing with certainty that God knows and wants what is best for us is
                often difficult, but it should not be.<br>

                “…And whosoever fears God and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every
                difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine….” (Quran 65:2-3)<br>

                God replaced Ishmael with a sheep and it is for this reason that Muslims sacrifice an animal on the
                celebration of Eid ul Adha; however it is more than a celebration, it is a reminder. We are reminded of
                our own submission to the will of God. Those Muslim’s who are not making the pilgrimage and who can
                afford it sacrifice an animal in remembrance of Prophet Ibrahim’s test.<br>

                “Their meat will not reach Allah, nor will their blood, but what reaches Him is piety from you….”
                (Quran 22:37)<br>

                The act of animal sacrifice is often misunderstood. God has no need for the blood or the meat; in fact
                God has no need for any of our acts of worship. However for our own benefit God commands us to turn to
                Him and obey Him. God looks for our piety, our goodness and our charity. The animal sacrificed is
                usually a sheep, a goat or a cow.<br>

                Distributing the meat from the sacrifice of Eid al-Adha strengthens many of our efforts to please God
                with our piety. Usually, a portion is eaten by the immediate family and relatives, a portion is given
                away to friends and neighbours and a portion is donated to the poor. The act symbolizes our willingness
                to give up our bounties to strengthen ties of kinship and friendship and our enthusiasm to give up
                things that are of benefit to us in order to help those who are in need. In the sacrifice we recognize
                that all blessings come from God.<br>

                Eid ul Adha commences on the 10th day of Dhul Hijjah. For those who are not at the pilgrimage, it begins
                with an extra early morning prayer performed in congregation, called the Eid prayer. It is a time of
                celebration, a time to visit family and friends and thank God for all the blessings He has bestowed upon
                us. It demands contact with relatives, kindness to family and neighbours, and empathy and compassion for
                the poor. Above all Eid ul Adha reminds us that God is great and that He is the source of all bounties.
                Through the good times and the trying times God is the source of all comfort and all peace, and
                submission to Him brings the greatest benefits of all.</p><br>
