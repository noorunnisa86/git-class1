<P style="font-size: 18px; font-weight:bold; text-align:center;">There are two official holidays that are celebrated in Islam. One is Eid al-Fitr, which celebrates the breaking of the fast at the end of Ramadan. The other is Eid al-Adha. In this article, we’ll explain everything you need to know about Eid al-Adha, including what it is, how it’s celebrated, and more.</P>
<div>
<h2 style=margin-left:20px;color:darkslateblue;>EID-AL-FITR</h2>
<P style="line-height: 26px;">
 
    Eid al-Fitr is an Islamic festival that marks the end of Ramadan, the holy month of fasting when Muslims fast from dawn to dusk each day. It is the first time Muslims can eat during daylight hours after fasting during Ramadan. The translation of “Eid al-Fitr” from Arabic sums up the holiday as it means “festival of breaking the fast.”
    
    Eid al-Fitr is celebrated during the first three days of Shawwal, which is the tenth month in the Muslim (lunar) calendar. This means that the timing of Eid al-Fitr (and Ramadan) is different every year as it is based on the lunar cycle. It does not begin until the new moon is seen, which means it starts at different times for different Muslims around the world. However, some Muslims choose to celebrate Eid al-Fitr when the new moon first appears over Mecca instead of their own locations.
    
    Muslims around the world perform communal prayer at daybreak on the first day of Eid al-Fitr, after cleansing themselves and donning new clothes. They then continue to celebrate for three days. A common greeting during Eid al-Fitr is “Eid Mubarak,” which means “Blessed Eid.” This greeting is used to wish other Muslims well during Eid. 
    
    These celebrations during Eid al-Fitr vary from country to country but include visiting family and friends, giving presents, enjoying feasts, wearing new clothes, and visiting the graves of relatives. Through these celebrations, Muslims show their gratitude to Allah after reflecting and fasting during Ramadan. 
    
    This holiday is also a reminder for Muslims to be grateful for what they have as well as to help the less fortunate. This is known as zakat, which is one of the five pillars of Islam. Zakat is a requirement that all Muslims with the means to do so donate to the less fortunate. Zakat significantly increases during Ramadan and continues as an important part of Eid al-Fitr.
    Eid al-Fitr, first of two canonical festivals of Islam. Eid al-Fitr marks the end of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of fasting, and is celebrated during the first three days of Shawwāl, the 10th month of the Islamic calendar (though the Muslim use of a lunar calendar means that it may fall in any season of the year). As in Islam’s other holy festival, Eid al-Adha, it is distinguished by the performance of communal prayer (ṣalāt) at daybreak on its first day. Eid al-Fitr is a time of official receptions and private visits, when friends greet one another, presents are given, new clothes are worn, and the graves of relatives are visited.</P>

<h2 style=margin-left:16px;color:darkslateblue;>EID-UL-ADHA</h2>
<p style="line-height: 26px;"> 
<h6 style="font-size: 20px;">What Is Eid al-Adha?</h6> 
The Eid al-Adha holiday—often referred to as “Big Eid” or “the Greater Eid”—is an Islamic holiday that honors Ibrahim’s (Abraham) devotion and obedience to Allah. The holiday specifically commemorates Ibrahim’s willingness to sacrifice his son Ismail (Ishmael) when Allah commanded him to. However, before Ibrahim could do so, Allah provided him with a ram to sacrifice in Ismail’s place. In Arabic, “Eid al-Adha” translates to “Festival of Sacrifice.”
<br>
 

<h6 style="font-size: 20px;"> When Is Eid Ul-Adha?</h6>
The date of Eid al-Adha is determined by the Islamic lunar calendar, so it varies each year. However, Eid al-Adha falls on the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah—the last month of the Islamic calendar—and lasts for four days. It can be difficult to know exactly when Eid will be, as the dates shift about 11 days earlier each year in the international (Gregorian) calendar. In 2022, the approximate start of Eid al-Adha will be celebrated between sundown on Saturday, July 9th, and sundown on Sunday, July 10th, and will last several days after.

 

<h6  style="font-size: 20px;">  How Is Eid Ul-Adha Celebrated?</h6>
Eid ul-Adha observances and celebrations include going to a mosque to pray any time between when the sun completely rises to just before the entering of Zuhr time—known as the noon prayer—on the 10th of Dhu al-Hijjah.

 

For many Muslims, Eid Ul-Adha marks the culmination of Hajj (pilgrimage)—which is the Fifth Pillar of Islam—rites at Minā, Saudi Arabia, near Mecca. This annual pilgrimage is taken by men and women who are financially and physically able to take it once in their lifetime, and the end of the pilgrimage coincides with the end of Eid al-Adha.

 

Another part of Eid Ul-Adha is food. As another way of commemorating Ibrahim’s willingness to sacrifice Ismail, families will sacrifice a ritually acceptable animal, like a cow, goat, sheep, or camel. The family then consumes a portion of the meat from the slaughtered animal, giving the rest to the poor and needy, demonstrating another Pillar of Islam—zakat.

 
Similar to Eid Ul-Fitr, Eid al-Adha is a time when Muslims wear new clothes, exchange gifts, and enjoy feasts with family and friends. Muslims also wish one another a happy Eid al-Adha with greetings. One common phrase that is used during both Eid al-Adha and Eid al-Fitr is “Eid Mubarak,” which means “Blessed Eid.” You may also hear a variation of the phrase, “Eid al-Adha Mubarak.” By saying this, Muslims are wishing one another good fortune and well-being.
